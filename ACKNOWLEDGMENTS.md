## WizFile

FastSearch's MFT reading capabilities are inspired by the innovative work of the WizFile team. Their approach to fast file searching by directly accessing the NTFS Master File Table demonstrated the power and efficiency of this method.

**WizFile** ([antibody-software.com](https://www.antibody-software.com/)) showed the world that file searching doesn't require background indexing to be incredibly fast. We appreciate their contribution to the Windows utility ecosystem.
